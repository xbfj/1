    <p>This man is fighting his own war and he has no rules. No boundaries. He doesn't flinch at torture, human trafficking, or genocide. He's not loyal to a flag or country or any set of ideals. He trades blood for money. He's your new best friend. You don't want to know what it's cost already to put you next to him. It will cost you a piece of yourself. It will cost nothing compared to everything you'll save.</p>

    <p>People love to call Drake soft or sensitive but this freestyle further proves that Drake is the demonic, goon employing thug, that Tupac and Biggie were thought to be. If the ominous drill beat didn't spell it out, Drake is one of the realest threats in the rap game and can get anyone killed if he wishes. Kanye said it himself about Drake in 2018, "He running around like he pac", that's because Drake is the new modern day Pac. He's really running around with a strap on his hip, has killer goons on command, is affiliated with the mafia, and has bodyguards that look like they eat nails in a bowl of blood. He had Kanye fearing for his dear life and kids lives in 2018 when the beef was popping. Drake really is the demon of Calabasas and Hollywood. We're looking at a real life Godfather Michael Corleone type figure, a gang affiliated Michael Jackson tier pop-star but on a much grander scale than MJ ever was. There's so many stories of Drake's getting rude yutes clapped up or performing mob boss gestures like throat slices, clapping his hands, etc. Drake dines at mafia style restaurants like The Nice Guy/Delilah in Hollywod. And he has enough power to bully superstar celebrities like Tory and Kanye around and make them think twice about their actions. This ninja Don Corleone runs every corner and inch of Canada and claimed it as his own. For the first time in forever we're looking at an invincible GOAT who really lives the stories.</p>
